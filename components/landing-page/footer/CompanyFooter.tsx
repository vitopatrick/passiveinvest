            Margin trading involves a high level of risk, and may not be
            suitable for all investors. You should carefully consider your
            objectives, financial situation, needs and level of experience
            before entering into any margined transactions with passive trading
            , and seek independent advice if necessary. Forex and Derivatives
            (margin trading) are highly leveraged products which mean both gains
            and losses are magnified. You should only trade in these products if
            you fully understand the risks involved and can afford losses
            without adversely affecting your lifestyle (including the risk of
            losing the entirety of your initial investment). You must assess and
            consider them carefully before making any decision about using our
            products or services. CFDs are complex instruments and come with a
            high risk of losing money rapidly due to leverage. The majority of
            retail investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs. You should
            consider whether you understand how CFDs work and whether you can
            afford to take the high risk of losing your money.
